5. Ensure all tests pass: `go test -v`
6. Commit with descriptive messages
7. Push to your fork and create a PR

### Issues

- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Provide clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Include Go version, GORM version, and DuckDB version

## Roadmap to Official GORM Integration

### Current Status

- ✅ Core implementation complete
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Documentation and examples
- 🔄 Community testing and feedback
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Additional features based on community needs
- ⏳ Submission to go-gorm organization

### How You Can Help

1. **Test the driver** with your applications
2. **Report issues** or edge cases
3. **Contribute features** like advanced data types
4. **Improve documentation** and examples
5. **Performance testing** and optimization
6. **Community feedback** and adoption

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components

- `dialector.go`: Main GORM dialector implementation
- `migrator.go`: Schema migration and introspection
- Connection wrapper for DuckDB-specific handling
- Auto-increment via DuckDB sequences

### Design Decisions

- Uses `information_schema` for introspection (no schema filtering needed)
- Implements connection wrapper for `*time.Time` → `time.Time` conversion
- Follows GORM patterns established by MySQL/PostgreSQL drivers
- Comprehensive error handling and translation
